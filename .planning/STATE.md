# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-23)

**Core value:** A Go server that an unmodified vanilla Minecraft 26.2 client can connect to, log into, and play in a persistent, ticking world — architected from day one for Leaf-style async optimizations.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation: Fork & Codegen (proto 776 data)

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 9 (Foundation — Fork & Codegen)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-06-23 — Roadmap created, 45/45 v1 requirements mapped across 9 phases

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Dependency-forced 9-phase spine — protocol-state sequence forces early order; codegen (Phase 1) gates everything.
- [Roadmap]: "Vanilla logic first, Leaf optimizations last" — Phases 5-7 build synchronous reference implementations; Phase 8 swaps executors behind pre-built seams.
- [Roadmap]: Ownership-based synchronization established in Phase 3 (near-zero cost single-threaded) is the insurance policy that keeps Phases 8-9 additive, not a rewrite.
- [Roadmap]: Game-time anchored to 50ms (TICK-02) + CS2-style subtick layer (TICK-03) — deliberate, not vanilla 20-TPS naive scaling.

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- Bleeding-edge risk: proto 776 post-dates go-mc, the wiki, and training data. All exact 776 byte layouts must be jar-derived/capture-diffed, not asserted from memory. Affects Phases 1, 2, 4, 5.
- Phases flagged for deeper per-phase research (`/gsd-research-phase`): 1 (codegen retarget), 2 (Configuration registry set), 4 (chunk section layout), 5 (teleport/spawn layout), 9 (vanilla-parity worldgen).
